Real-Time Geospatial Intelligence: Leveraging Rust WebAssembly and Predictive AI for Browser-Based SpatialÂ Queries.

Abstract
This paper explores a hybrid approach to real-time geospatial intelligence by leveraging Rust WebAssembly for browser-based spatial computations and Python-based predictive AI models for advanced geospatial reasoning. The proposed system allows real-time point-in-polygon (PIP) analysis and clustering in the browser while offloading computationally intensive predictive tasks (e.g., traffic forecasting, geospatial feature analysis) to a Python backend using GeoBERT. We also generate synthetic geospatial datasets to demonstrate scalability, practical use cases, and efficiency improvements in browser-based and hybrid geospatial processing systems.
